# TLPuk

We present a Matlab-based functional enviroment, TLPuk that simulates risk-based red-light thresholds for use in defining traffic light protocols.  This is a collection of codes applied in a study about hydraulic fracturing in the UK [Schultz et al., 2022].  See also, prior works in developing this approach (as well as their GitHub repositories).

These files are a collection of matlab programs and scripts: scriptRISK.m creates the datastructure and then scriptPLOTRISK.m plots the output results.

Note that licensed databases are missing from this work enviroment (Vs30 & population).  This will require the user to find their own datasources to adapt the approach.
